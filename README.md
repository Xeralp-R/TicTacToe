# TicTacToe
A Qt implementation of the game Tic Tac Toe

## Overview
This project was created in fulfillment of the 
requirements for bonus points in our CS class.

## Features
* Decent design
* Accompaniment music
* 2 robots: 1 designed by the cocreator Brent, and a randomized robot
* Tournament Mode: play 5 turns against the opponent
* Replay button
* Player names and Characters: now supports unicode!

## Running the Project
1. Ensure QT is downloaded
2. Download this stuff
3. Run it in QTCreator

In the future, I might make a tarball for linux or a DMG file for mac— I will also place it in this repository.

## Dependencies
If you're going to download directly from github, you will need QT to dynamically link it.
Else— that is, if you're going to use the dmg or tarball— I don't think there are any dependencies.
